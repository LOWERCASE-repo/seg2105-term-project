Course Booking application for Android devices
University of Ottawa - Faculty of Engineering - SEG2105

This application will implement a basic course selection service for students and
instructors. Students will be able to search for a course, instructors will be able to edit
details about their own course, and an administrator will manage users and courses.


The administrator can:
 1. Login to an administrator account. The developer should pre-create such an account with these credentials:
   a. Username: admin
   b. Password: admin123
 2. Create, edit, and delete courses.
   a. To create a course, the administrator only specifies the course code and course name. No other course information is specified by the admin. For example, the admin wants to add a history course to the list of all courses.
     i. Course code: HIS101, Course name: History
   b. The administrator can edit the course code and course name.
   c. The administrator can delete a course entirely.
 3. Delete accounts of instructors and students.


An instructor can:
 1. Create an instructor account and login to that account.
 2. View and search all courses.
 3. Assign themselves as an instructor to a course they would like to teach.
 4. Add and edit the course days, course hours, course description, and course student capacity for the courses they are instructing.
 5. Un-assign themselves from a course, which deletes the course details.


A student can:
 1. Create a student account and login to that account.
 2. View all available courses.
 3. Search for courses by course code, course name, or by date.
 4. Enroll and unenroll from courses.
